## Installation

To add the toolbox to a project, you add the package to the csproj project file:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Digipolis.ServiceAgents" Version="7.1.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
``` 

or if your project still works with project.json :

``` json
    "dependencies": {
        "Digipolis.ServiceAgents":  "7.1.0"
    }
```

ALWAYS check the latest version [here](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/serviceagents_aspnetcore/blob/master/src/Digipolis.ServiceAgents/Digipolis.ServiceAgents.csproj) before adding the above line !

In Visual Studio you can also use the NuGet Package Manager to do this.

## Usage

To add a single service agent in your project simply use the **AddSingleServiceAgent&lt;T>** extension in the **ConfigureServices** method in the **Startup** class. The type represents the implementation of your service agent. It will be registered as a typed client, i.e. transient service which expects a HttpClient to be injected in via the constructor. 
If the service agent implements an interface of the same name preceded with the letter ‘I’, the interface will be registered with the Service Agent as implementation type.
Generic types must be registered via AddSingleServiceAgent.

``` csharp
    services.AddSingleServiceAgent<YourServiceAgent>(settings =>
    {
        settings.Scheme = "http";
        settings.Host = "test.com";
        settings.Path = "api";
        settings.Headers = new Dictionary<string, string>()
        {
            { "apikey", "apikeyvalue" },
            { "X-Custom-Header", "customheadervalue" },
        };
    });
```
The parameter of type **Action&lt;ServiceSettings>** allows you to set the settings for the service agent.

If you want to configure the agent using a configuration file or if you want to register multiple service agents, use the **AddServiceAgents** extension instead.

``` csharp
    services.AddServiceAgents(settings =>
    {
        settings.FileName = Path.Combine(ConfigPath, "serviceagents.json");
    });
```

If your agents are located in a different assembly then the executing assembly, you can pass that assembly as a parameter, this is optional.

``` csharp
    services.AddServiceAgents(settings =>
    {
        settings.FileName = Path.Combine(ConfigPath, "serviceagents.json");
    },
	assembly: AssemblyWithAgents);
```

The json file contains one or multiple sections, one per service agent.

The structure of the json file is:

``` javascript
{
    "Global": {
    },
    "TestAgent": {
      "AuthScheme": "None",
      "Host": "test.be",
      "Path": "api",
      "Port": "5001",
      "Scheme": "http",
      "Headers": {
          "apikey": "123456789",
          "X-Custom-Header": "customheadervalue"
      }
    }
}
```

A first object (section) section named **Global** can optionally be defined.
THis section is intended for settings that are common to all the service agents.

Each other object (section) in the json represents a service agent type. **The object name has to match the service agent type name**.
See the [Creating a service agent](#creating-a-service-agent) section for more info on creating the service agents.

Following options can be set per section (service agent):

Option              | Description                                                | Default | Mandatory
------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------
AuthScheme              | The authentication scheme to be used by the service agent. | "None" |
Host | The host part of the url for the service agent. | "" | X
Path | The path part of the url for the service agent. | "" |
Port | The port for the service agent. | 443 fo https, 80 for http |
Scheme | The scheme of the url for the service agent. | "https" |
Headers | A key-value collection representing the headers to be added to the requests. | null |
BasicAuthUserName | The user name used for basic authentication scheme. | "" | With BasicAuth scheme
BasicAuthPassword | The password used for basic authentication scheme. | "" | With BasicAuth scheme
OAuthPathAddition | Oauth path addition for OAuth authentication scheme. | "" | With Oauth scheme
OAuthClientId | Oauth client id for OAuth authentication scheme. | "" | With Oauth scheme
OAuthClientSecret | Oauth client secret for OAuth authentication scheme. | "" | With Oauth scheme
OAuthScope | Oauth scopt for OAuth authentication scheme. | "" | With Oauth scheme

All the url parts form the basic url for the service agent: {scheme}://{host}:{port}/{path}/

An overloaded method for both **AddSingleServiceAgent&lt;T>** and **AddServiceAgents** is available where you can pass a "clientCreatedAction" parameter of type **Action&lt;IServiceProvider, HttpClient>** that gets invoked when the underlying HttpClient gets created. That way you can customize the created client.

Important notice: the action gets invoked for every service agent when multiple are registered!
``` csharp
    services.AddServiceAgents(s =>
    {
        s.FileName = Path.Combine(ConfigPath, "serviceagents.json");
        s.Section = "TestAgent";
    }, ...,
    (serviceProvider, client) =>
    {
        //customize the client
    });
```

With this overloaded method of **AddSingleServiceAgent&lt;T>** or **AddServiceAgents** it is also possible to pass a "clientBuiltAction" parameter of type **Action&lt;string, IHttpClientBuilder>**. This gets invoked after the registration of the Service Agent as a typed client and allows you to add custom behaviour with the provided HttpClientBuilder, ex. adding delegating handers. The String argument is set to the Service Agent's type name.

Important notice: the action gets invoked for every service agent when multiple are registered!
``` csharp
    services.AddServiceAgents(s =>
    {
        s.FileName = Path.Combine(ConfigPath, "serviceagents.json");
        s.Section = "TestAgent";
    }, 
	...,
    (string, httpClientBuilder) =>
    {
        //customize the client
        httpClientBuilder.AddHttpMessageHandler<ValidateHeaderHandler>();
    });
```

## Creating a service agent

In order to create a service agent you need to create a type that derives from **AgentBase**.

``` csharp
    public class DemoAgent : AgentBase
    {
        public DemoAgent(HttpClient client, IServiceProvider serviceProvider, IOptions<ServiceAgentSettings> options)
            : base(client, serviceProvider, options)
        {
        }
    }
```

The **AgentBase** class contains several protected methods to perform the basic http actions (get, post, put, patch and delete). All the methods are async.

Some examples:

Implement a get operation

``` csharp
    public class DemoAgent : AgentBase
    {
        public DemoAgent(HttpClient client, IServiceProvider serviceProvider, IOptions<ServiceAgentSettings> options)
            : base(client, serviceProvider, options)
        {
        }

        //A basic get operation
        public Task<Address> GetAddressAsync(int id)
        {
            return base.GetAsync<Address>($"adress?id={id}");
        }

        //A basic post operation
        public Task<Address> PostAddressAsync(Address adress)
        {
            return base.PostAsync<Address>("adress", adress);
        }
    }
```

If you want to return the response as string you can use the **GetStringAsync** method on the **Agentbase**.

``` csharp
    public Task<string> GetAddressAsStringAsync(int id)
    {
        return base.GetStringAsync($"adress?id={id}");
    }
```

If you want to get the response itself, you can use the **GetResponseAsync** method on the **Agentbase**. Only responses with status success will be returned.

``` csharp
    public Task<HttpResponseMessage> GetServiceMethodResponseAsync(int id)
    {
        return base.GetResponseAsync($"adress?id={id}");
    }
```


## Using a service agent

In order to use a service agent simply ask the **serviceProvider** for an instance of the agent's type and use it.

For example in a controller:

``` csharp
    public class ValuesController : Controller
    {
        private DemoAgent _serviceAgent;

        public ValuesController(DemoAgent serviceAgent)
        {
            _serviceAgent = serviceAgent;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<string> Get()
        {
            var result = await _serviceAgent.GetAddressAsync(1);

            //do something...

            return "somestring";
        }
    }
```

If your agent implements an interface with the same name preceded with an **I**, the agent is registered as an implementation of that interface.
In that case you need to request an instance of the interface type:

``` csharp
    //The service agent implementation
    public class DemoAgent : AgentBase, IDemoAgent
    {
        public DemoAgent(HttpClient client, IServiceProvider serviceProvider, IOptions<ServiceAgentSettings> options)
            : base(client, serviceProvider, options)
        {
        }

        //Some implementation
    }

    //The usage
    public class ValuesController : Controller
    {
        private IDemoAgent _serviceAgent;

        public ValuesController(IDemoAgent serviceAgent)
        {
            _serviceAgent = serviceAgent;
        }
    }
```  

## Authentication schemes

Different schemes are available to be used with the service agents.

Possible schemes:

* None
* Bearer
* OAuthClientCredentials
* Basic

**Note!** Since version 4.0.0 of the toolbox the "ApiKey" scheme has been removed. If you need to add api key to the request, use the "Headers" property of the **ServiceSettings**.
This allows you to combine an authentication scheme with an api key header.

Check the [Creating a service agent](#creating-a-service-agent) section to see how to define the scheme for your service agents.

### None

No authentication is done.

### Bearer

With the Bearer scheme the authentication is done through use of the authorization header:

    Authorization Bearer xxx
where xxx is the token.
To use the Bearer scheme set the **AuthScheme** property of the **ServiceSettings** object to the value "Bearer".
The token is extracted from the **UserToken** property of the **AuthContext** object provided by the dependency injection infrastructure.


### OAuthClientCredentials

This will use the OAuth2 client credentials flow to obtain a (bearer)token from a token endpoint.

To use the OAuth Clientcredentials scheme set the **AuthScheme** property of the **ServiceSettings** object to the value "OAuthClientCredentials".

You must also supply following settings in the ServiceSettings:
``` csharp
  OAuthClientId = "f44d3641-8249-440d-a6e5-61b7b4893184";
  OAuthClientSecret = "2659485f-f0be-4526-bb7a-0541365351f5";
  OAuthScope = "testoauthDigipolis.v2.all";
  OAuthPathAddition = "oauth2/token";
```

Before each call a check occurs to validate the lifetime of the OAuth access token. If no valid token is found, a new one is requested with the provided configuration settings.

See the SampleApi for more info.

### Basic

With the Basic scheme the authentication is done through use of a Basic Authentication header.

    Authorization Basic yyy
where yyy is the base 64 encoded username and password, with username containing an optional domain

Basic authentication can only be used with an "https" scheme except for the **Development** environment!

To use the Basic scheme set the **AuthScheme** property of the **ServiceSettings** object to the value "Basic".
The **user name** and **password** can be entered in the settings.
``` javascript
{
    "Global": {
    },
    "TestAgent": {
      "AuthScheme": "Basic",
      "Host": "test.be",
      "Path": "api",
      "Port": "5001",
      "Scheme": "https",
      "BasicAuthDomain": "domain",
      "BasicAuthUserName": "userName",
      "BasicAuthPassword": "password"
    }
}
```

If you don't want to enter your user name and password in the json configuration file you can use an overload of the **AddServiceAgents** method that accepts a parameter of type **Action&lt;ServiceAgentSettings&gt;**
to alter the values of the service settings after they have been loaded from the json file.
``` csharp
    services.AddServiceAgents(json =>
    {
        json.FileName = Path.Combine(ConfigPath, "serviceagents.json");
    }, serviceAgentSettings =>
    {
        var settings = serviceAgentSettings.Services.Single(s => s.Key == nameof(TestAgent)).Value; 
		settings.BasicAuthDomain = "domainfromcode"
        settings.BasicAuthPassword = "userNamefromcode";
        settings.BasicAuthUserName = "passwordfromcode";
    }, null);
```
